## Bachelor Project Specification
*Bachelor Project Specification/18596/2015/xvondr20*  
**Brno University of Technology - Faculty of Information Technology**  
Department of Information Systems, Academic year 2015/2016

For: **Vondráček Martin**  
Branch of study: Information Technology  
Title: **Automatization of MitM Attack on WiFi Networks**  
Category: Networking

### Instructions for project work
1. Study different kinds of security approaches used in wireless networks. Focus on known vulnerabilities of individual methods and on tools for exploiting these vulnerabilities.
2. Consider the possibility of impersonification of specified AP in case that attack on given device is not available.
3. Utilize existing tools from points 1), 2) and choose the most appropriate one or a set of them, which will be able to realize automatic attack on chosen network.
4. Implement a tool capable of such automation. This tool will be able to choose the most suitable attack or a sequence of them.
5. Test the solution during experiments in laboratories. Evaluate the success rate of implemented solution against different kinds of existing AP.

### Requirements for the first semester
Items 1, 2 a 3.

**Detailed formal specifications can be found at [http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/info/szz/](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/info/szz/).**

*The Bachelor Thesis must define its purpose, describe a current state of the art, introduce the theoretical and technical background relevant to the problems solved, and specify what parts have been used from earlier projects or 
have been taken over from other sources.*

*Each student will hand-in printed as well as electronic versions of the technical report, an electronic version of the complete program documentation, program source files, and a functional hardware prototype sample if desired. 
The information in electronic form will be stored on a standard non-rewritable medium (CD-R, DVD-R, etc.) in formats common at the FIT. In order to allow regular handling, the medium will be securely attached to the printed 
report.*
