### Abstract

Widely used network technologies and principles of wireless security suffer weaknesses that can be exploited to perform the&nbsp;Man-in-the-Middle attack, allowing to eavesdrop or to spoof the&nbsp;network communication. The&nbsp;work focuses on possibilities of automation of the&nbsp;attack with a&nbsp;utilization of available specialized tools. The&nbsp;outcome of the&nbsp;research is the&nbsp;wifimitm package and the&nbsp;wifimitmcli CLI tool, both implemented in Python. The&nbsp;emphasis was placed on possibilities of further incorporation of the&nbsp;developed tool. The&nbsp;package provides functionality for automated MitM attack and can be used by other software. The&nbsp;wifimitmcli tool is capable of performing a&nbsp;successful fully automated attack without any intervention from an attacker.

This research can be used for automated penetration testing and forensic&nbsp;investigation. Finally, a&nbsp;popularization of the&nbsp;fact that such severe attacks can be successfully automated should be used to raise the&nbsp;public awareness about the&nbsp;information security. In&nbsp;these days, this issue involves almost every one&nbsp;of&nbsp;us.
